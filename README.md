### To spin up the frontend server:

1. Clone repository in your terminal in desired file location: `git clone https://github.com/crevulus/connectory.git`
2. Navigate to /connectory-frontend
3. `npm start` in your terminal, should load up frontend on localhost:3000

### To use json-server

1. Naviagte to same folder as above
2. `npm run stubapi` in your terminal, should load up `db.json` file on localhost:8080
3. Send `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE` etc. as you would a normal API. The one caveat: to update an existing data object without overwriting it completely, use `PATCH` instead of `POST`.
